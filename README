Mumble9000

This is a fork of Mumble (client and server) for use
by the Team9000 gaming community.

The client is backward compatible with standard Mumble servers.

The server is not backward compatible, and will break terribly
if you try to use it without the supporting team9000 authentication
and chat management connector.
